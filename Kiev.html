                Was building 500-1000. It is the bigest city of the Ukrain. I can say that the Kiev is the center of the Ukraine history.
                Because the each important event in the Ukraine started from the Kiev. And the each monument say about it.
                How the: Golden gate, Colon of the Independence, Templs of the Saint Sofia and so.far.
                For example: The Epiphany started from the Kiev, Almost everything revolution started from the Kiev, Our independence started from the Kiev.
                And these everything facts is not strange.Because Kiev is very old city. Which even was a capital of the Kievan Rus. Which broke up in 1430.
